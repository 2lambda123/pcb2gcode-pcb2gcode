     * path from each vertex with more paths out than in.  In the reversible
     * case, that means an odd path count.  Follow the path until it ends.
     *
     * For the reversible case, the start vertex will have count decrease by
     * one, the end vertex will decrease from 1 to 0, and all other vertices
     * will decrease by two.  So the result is that two vertices will have the
     * edges counts go from odd to even and the rest will have edge counts stay
     * either odd or even.
     *
     * For non-reversible, we only start at vertices where the out edges is
     * greater than in edges.  A path must start at those because any path that
     * goes through will subtract one from both inbound and outbound edge counts
     * so eventually the vertex will end with only outbound eddges and so must
     * be the start of a path.  For the new path, the start vertex will have
     * outbound count decreased by one.  The end path will have inbound
     * decreased by one and outbound must be zero.  All middle vertices will
     * have inbound and outbound decreased by one each.  The result is that the
     * outbound minus inbound count for each vertex stays the same except for
     * the start where it goes one down by one and the end where it goes up by
     * one.  The start was positive because we only started at edges where
     * outbound was greater than inbound and the end must have been negative
     * because outbound is zero.  So both the start and end vertex outbound
     * minus inbound move closer to zero by one.  Doing this on all vertices
     * where outbound is greater than inbound will bring all those vertices to
     * outbound==inbound.  And because the total_outbound==total_inbound, that
     * means that all vertices will have the same number of outbound and
     * inbound, which means that we have made the precondition to stitch_loops.
