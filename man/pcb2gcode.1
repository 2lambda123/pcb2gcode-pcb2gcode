.SH NAME
pcb2gcode \- manual page for pcb2gcode 2.4.0
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBpcb2gcode\fP command.
.PP
\fBpcb2gcode\fP is a program that takes the files typically produced by PCB
(printed circuit board) designing tools, in particular Gerber (RS-274X) and
Excellon (an RS-274C variant) files as parsed by \fBgerbv\fP, and produces
files that can be used to control a CNC (computer numerical control) milling
machine. These files are in G code format (RS-274D/NGC) that can be read, for
example, by the linuxcnc EMC2 system.

When these files are executed, an engraving bit is used to remove the surface
from a copper covered circuit board, thus creating isolated areas. In another
step, holes are drilled into the board at the appropriate positions, and it can
be cut out in another step. (For each step, a separate output file is created.)

These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.

Instead of passing all options on the command line, nearly all options can be
stored in a file named \fImillproject\fP. There, options are given one per line
as \fIoption\fP=\fIvalue\fP pairs (without the two dashes), and can be
separated by blank lines and commented (everything after a `#` character is
treated as a comment). Options that don't take an argument (like
\fB\-\-metric\fP) are entered as \fIoption\fP=true or \fIoption\fP=1 there.

Unless configured otherwise, numeric values are in units of inch and
inch/minute. When the \fB\-\-metric\fP option is given, they are in mm and
mm/minute.
